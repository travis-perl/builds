#pod
#pod This plugin will extract loosely your distribution prerequisites from

#pod This plugin will skip the modules shipped within your dist.

#pod B<Note>, if you have any non-Perl files in your C<t/> directory or other
#pod directories being scanned, be sure to mark those files' encoding as C<bytes>
#pod with the L<Encoding|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Encoding> plugin so they won't be

#pod
#pod This is the name of a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder>

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoPrereqs - automatically extract prereqs from your modules

=head1 VERSION

version 6.017

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [AutoPrereqs]
  skip = ^Foo|Bar$
  skip = ^Other::Dist

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will extract loosely your distribution prerequisites from
your files using L<Perl::PrereqScanner>.

If some prereqs are not found, you can still add them manually with the
L<Prereqs|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs> plugin.

This plugin will skip the modules shipped within your dist.

B<Note>, if you have any non-Perl files in your C<t/> directory or other
directories being scanned, be sure to mark those files' encoding as C<bytes>
with the L<Encoding|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Encoding> plugin so they won't be
scanned:

    [Encoding]
    encoding = bytes
    match    = ^t/data/

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 finder

This is the name of a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder>
whose files will be scanned to determine runtime prerequisites.  It
may be specified multiple times.  The default value is
C<:InstallModules> and C<:ExecFiles>.

=head2 test_finder

Just like C<finder>, but for test-phase prerequisites.  The default
value is C<:TestFiles>.

=head2 configure_finder

Just like C<finder>, but for configure-phase prerequisites.  There is
no default value; AutoPrereqs will not determine configure-phase
prerequisites unless you set configure_finder.

=head2 develop_finder

Just like C<finder>, but for develop-phase prerequisites.  The default value
is C<:ExtraTestFiles>.

=head2 skips

This is an arrayref of regular expressions, derived from all the 'skip' lines
in the configuration.  Any module names matching any of these regexes will not
be registered as prerequisites.

=head2 relationship

The relationship used for the registered prerequisites. The default value is
'requires'; other options are 'recommends' and 'suggests'.

=head2 extra_scanners

This is an arrayref of scanner names (as expected by L<Perl::PrereqScanner>).
It will be passed as the C<extra_scanners> parameter to L<Perl::PrereqScanner>.

=head2 scanners

This is an arrayref of scanner names (as expected by L<Perl::PrereqScanner>).
If present, it will be passed as the C<scanners> parameter to
L<Perl::PrereqScanner>, which means that it will replace the default list
of scanners.

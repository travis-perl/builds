    # Okay, look, buddy‚Ä¶  If you're using a BOM on UTF-8, that's fine.  You can
    # use it.  You're just not going to get it back.  If we don't do this, the
    # sequence of events will be:
    # * read file from UTF-8-BOM file on disk
    # * end up with FEFF as first character of file
    # * pass file content to PPI
    # * PPI blows up
    #
    # I'm not going to try to account for the BOM and add it back.  It's awful!
    #
    # Meanwhile, if you're using UTF-16, you can get the BOM handled by picking
    # the right encoding type, I think. -- rjbs, 2016-04-24

=head2 name

This is the name of the file to be written out.

=head2 added_by

This is a list of strings describing when and why the file was added
to the distribution and when it was updated (its content, filename, or other attributes).  It will

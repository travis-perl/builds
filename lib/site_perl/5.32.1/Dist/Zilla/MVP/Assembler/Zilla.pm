=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler::Zilla - Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler for the Dist::Zilla object

=head1 VERSION

version 6.017

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a subclass of L<Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler> used when assembling the
Dist::Zilla object.

It has a C<zilla_class> attribute, which is used to determine what class of
Dist::Zilla object to create.  (This isn't very useful now, but will be in the
future when minting and building use different subclasses of Dist::Zilla.)

Upon construction, the assembler will create a L<Dist::Zilla::MVP::RootSection>
as the initial section.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 zilla

This method is a shortcut for retrieving the C<zilla> from the root section.
If called before that section has been finalized, it will result in an
exception.

=head2 register_stash

  $assembler->register_stash($name => $stash_object);

This adds a stash to the assembler's zilla's stash registry -- unless the name
is already taken, in which case an exception is raised.

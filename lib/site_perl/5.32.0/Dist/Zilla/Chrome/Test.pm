#pod
#pod The response_for attribute (which exists only in the Test chrome) is a
#pod hashref that lets you specify the answer to questions asked by
#pod C<prompt_str> or C<prompt_yn>.  The key is the prompt string.  If the
#pod value is a string, it is returned every time that question is asked.
#pod If the value is an arrayref, the first element is shifted off and
#pod returned every time the question is asked.  If the arrayref is empty
#pod (or the prompt is not listed in the hash), the default answer (if any)
#pod is returned.
#pod
#pod Since you can't pass arguments to the Chrome constructor, response_for
#pod is initialized to an empty hash, and you can add entries after
#pod construction with the C<set_response_for> method:
#pod

=head2 response_for

The response_for attribute (which exists only in the Test chrome) is a
hashref that lets you specify the answer to questions asked by
C<prompt_str> or C<prompt_yn>.  The key is the prompt string.  If the
value is a string, it is returned every time that question is asked.
If the value is an arrayref, the first element is shifted off and
returned every time the question is asked.  If the arrayref is empty
(or the prompt is not listed in the hash), the default answer (if any)
is returned.

Since you can't pass arguments to the Chrome constructor, response_for
is initialized to an empty hash, and you can add entries after
construction with the C<set_response_for> method:

  $chrome->set_response_for($prompt => $response);

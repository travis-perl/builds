=head1 NAME

Config::MVP::Sequence - an ordered set of named configuration sections

=head1 VERSION

version 2.200011

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Config::MVP::Sequence is an ordered set of configuration sections, each of
which has a name unique within the sequence.

For the most part, you can just consult L<Config::MVP> to understand what this
class is and how it's used.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 is_finalized

This attribute is true if the sequence has been marked finalized, which will
prevent any changes (via methods like C<add_section> or C<delete_section>).  It
can be set with the C<finalize> method.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_section

  $sequence->add_section($section);

This method adds the given section to the end of the sequence.  If the sequence
already contains a section with the same name as the new section, an exception
will be raised.

=head2 delete_section

  my $deleted_section = $sequence->delete_section( $name );

This method removes a section from the sequence and returns the removed
section.  If no section existed, the method returns false.

=head2 section_named

  my $section = $sequence->section_named( $name );

This method returns the section with the given name, if one exists in the
sequence.  If no such section exists, the method returns false.

=head2 section_names

  my @names = $sequence->section_names;

This method returns a list of the names of the sections, in order.

=head2 sections

  my @sections = $sequence->sections;

This method returns the section objects, in order.

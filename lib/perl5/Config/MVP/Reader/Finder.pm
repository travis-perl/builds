#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod The Finder reader multiplexes many other readers that implement the
#pod L<Config::MVP::Reader::Findable> role.  It uses L<Module::Pluggable> to search
#pod for modules, limits them to objects implementing the Findable role, and then
#pod selects the those which report that they are able to read a configuration file
#pod found in the config root directory.  If exactly one findable configuration
#pod reader finds a file, it is used to read the file and the configuration sequence
#pod is returned.  Otherwise, an exception is raised.
#pod
#pod Config::MVP::Reader::Finder's C<build_assembler> method will decline a new
#pod assembler, so if none was passed to C<read_config>, the Findable reader to
#pod which reading is delegated will be responsible for building the assembler,
#pod unless a Finder subclass overrides C<build_assembler> to set a default across
#pod all possible delegates.

Config::MVP::Reader::Finder - a reader that finds an appropriate file

=head1 VERSION

version 2.200011

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Finder reader multiplexes many other readers that implement the
L<Config::MVP::Reader::Findable> role.  It uses L<Module::Pluggable> to search
for modules, limits them to objects implementing the Findable role, and then
selects the those which report that they are able to read a configuration file
found in the config root directory.  If exactly one findable configuration
reader finds a file, it is used to read the file and the configuration sequence
is returned.  Otherwise, an exception is raised.

Config::MVP::Reader::Finder's C<build_assembler> method will decline a new
assembler, so if none was passed to C<read_config>, the Findable reader to
which reading is delegated will be responsible for building the assembler,
unless a Finder subclass overrides C<build_assembler> to set a default across
all possible delegates.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 default_search_path

This is the default search path used to find configuration readers.  This
method should return a list, and by default returns:

  qw( Config::MVP::Reader )

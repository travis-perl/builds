=head1 NAME

MooseX::Role::WithOverloading - Roles which support overloading

=head1 VERSION

version 0.14

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyRole;
    use MooseX::Role::WithOverloading;

    use overload
        q{""}    => 'as_string',
        fallback => 1;

    has message => (
        is       => 'rw',
        isa      => 'Str',
    );

    sub as_string { shift->message }

    package MyClass;
    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;

    with 'MyRole';

    package main;

    my $i = MyClass->new( message => 'foobar' );
    print $i; # Prints 'foobar'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooseX::Role::WithOverloading allows you to write a L<Moose::Role> which
defines overloaded operators and allows those overload methods to be
composed into the classes/roles/instances it's compiled to, where plain
L<Moose::Role>s would lose the overloading.

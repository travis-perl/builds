#pod
#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod This command builds and tests the distribution in "smoke testing mode."
#pod
#pod This command is a thin wrapper around the L<test|Dist::Zilla::Dist::Builder/test> method in
#pod Dist::Zilla.  It builds your dist and runs the tests with the AUTOMATED_TESTING
#pod environment variable turned on, so it's like doing this:
#pod
#pod   export AUTOMATED_TESTING=1
#pod   dzil build --no-tgz
#pod   cd $BUILD_DIRECTORY
#pod   perl Makefile.PL
#pod   make
#pod   make test
#pod
#pod A build that fails tests will be left behind for analysis, and F<dzil> will
#pod exit a non-zero value.  If the tests are successful, the build directory will
#pod be removed and F<dzil> will exit with status 0.

version 6.017

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dzil smoke [ --release ] [ --author ] [ --no-automated ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command builds and tests the distribution in "smoke testing mode."

This command is a thin wrapper around the L<test|Dist::Zilla::Dist::Builder/test> method in
Dist::Zilla.  It builds your dist and runs the tests with the AUTOMATED_TESTING
environment variable turned on, so it's like doing this:

  export AUTOMATED_TESTING=1
  dzil build --no-tgz
  cd $BUILD_DIRECTORY
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

A build that fails tests will be left behind for analysis, and F<dzil> will
exit a non-zero value.  If the tests are successful, the build directory will
be removed and F<dzil> will exit with status 0.

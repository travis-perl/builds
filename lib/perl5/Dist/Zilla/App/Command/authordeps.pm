#pod =head1 SYNOPSIS
#pod
#pod   $ dzil authordeps
#pod
#pod This will scan the F<dist.ini> file and print a list of plugin modules that
#pod probably need to be installed for the dist to be buildable.  This is a very
#pod naive scan, but tends to be pretty accurate.  Modules can be added to its
#pod results by using special comments in the form:
#pod
#pod   ; authordep Some::Package
#pod
#pod In order to add authordeps to all distributions that use a certain plugin bundle
#pod (or plugin), just list them as prereqs of that bundle (e.g.: using
#pod L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs> ).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ dzil authordeps

This will scan the F<dist.ini> file and print a list of plugin modules that
probably need to be installed for the dist to be buildable.  This is a very
naive scan, but tends to be pretty accurate.  Modules can be added to its
results by using special comments in the form:

  ; authordep Some::Package

In order to add authordeps to all distributions that use a certain plugin bundle
(or plugin), just list them as prereqs of that bundle (e.g.: using
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs> ).

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::StringFormatter - Provide a String::Formatter for commit messages

=head1 VERSION

version 2.042

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is used within the Git plugins to format strings that may
include the changes from the current release.

These formatting codes are available:

=over 4

=item C<%c>

The list of changes in the just-released version (read from C<changelog>).
It will include lines between the current version and timestamp and
the next non-indented line, except that blank lines at the beginning
or end are removed.  It always ends in a newline unless it is the empty string.

=item C<%{dd-MMM-yyyy}d>

The current date.  You can use any CLDR format supported by
L<DateTime>.  A bare C<%d> means C<%{dd-MMM-yyyy}d>.

=item C<%n>

a newline

=item C<%N>

the distribution name

=item C<%{-TRIAL}t>

Expands to -TRIAL (or any other supplied string) if this is a trial
release, or the empty string if not.  A bare C<%t> means C<%{-TRIAL}t>.

=item C<%v>

the distribution version

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 changelog

The filename of your F<Changes> file.  (Must be provided by the class
that consumes this role.)

=head2 time_zone

The time zone used with the C<%d> code.  The default is C<local>.

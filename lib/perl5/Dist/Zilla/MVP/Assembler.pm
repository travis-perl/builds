=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler - Dist::Zilla-specific subclass of Config::MVP::Assembler

=head1 VERSION

version 6.010

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Take this next bit seriously!>  If you don't understand how L<Config::MVP>
works, reading about how the Dist::Zilla-specific Assembler works is not going
to be useful.

Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler extends L<Config::MVP::Assembler> and composes
L<Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles>.  For potential plugin bundles (things
composing L<Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle>)

The Assembler has chrome, so it can log and will (eventually) be able to get
input from the user.

The Assembler's C<expand_package> method delegates to Dist::Zilla::Util's
L<expand_config_package_name|Dist::Zilla::Util/expand_config_package_name>
method.

The Assembler will throw an exception if it is instructed to add a value for
C<plugin_name> or C<zilla>.

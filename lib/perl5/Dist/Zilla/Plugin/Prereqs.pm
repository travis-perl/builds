#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod This module adds "fixed" prerequisites to your distribution.  These are prereqs
#pod with a known, fixed minimum version that doesn't change based on platform or
#pod other conditions.
#pod
#pod You can specify prerequisites for different phases and kinds of relationships.
#pod In C<RuntimeRequires>, the phase is Runtime and the relationship is Requires.
#pod These are described in more detail in the L<CPAN::Meta
#pod specification|CPAN::Meta::Spec/PREREQUISITES>.
#pod
#pod The phases are:
#pod
#pod =for :list
#pod * configure
#pod * build
#pod * test
#pod * runtime
#pod * develop
#pod
#pod The relationship types are:
#pod
#pod =for :list
#pod * requires
#pod * recommends
#pod * suggests
#pod * conflicts
#pod
#pod If the phase is omitted, it will default to I<runtime>; thus, specifying
#pod "Prereqs / Recommends" in your dist.ini is equivalent to I<RuntimeRecommends>.
#pod
#pod Not all of these phases are useful for all tools, especially tools that only
#pod understand version 1.x CPAN::Meta files.

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs - list simple prerequisites

=head1 VERSION

version 6.010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [Prereqs]
  Foo::Bar = 1.002
  MRO::Compat = 10
  Sub::Exporter = 0

You can specify requirements for different phases and relationships with:

  [Prereqs]
  -phase = test
  -relationship = recommends

  Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
  Text::SoundEx = 3

Remember that if you load two Prereqs plugins, each will needs its own name,
added like this:

  [Prereqs / PluginName]
  -phase = test
  -relationship = recommends

  Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
  Text::SoundEx = 3

If the name is the CamelCase concatenation of a phase and relationship
(or just a relationship), it will set those parameters implicitly.  If
you use a custom name, but it does not specify the relationship, and
you didn't specify either C<-phase> or C<-relationship>, it throws the
error C<No -phase or -relationship specified>.  This is to prevent a
typo that makes the name meaningless from slipping by unnoticed.

The example below is equivalent to the example above, except for the name of
the resulting plugin:

  [Prereqs / TestRecommends]
  Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
  Text::SoundEx = 3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds "fixed" prerequisites to your distribution.  These are prereqs
with a known, fixed minimum version that doesn't change based on platform or
other conditions.

You can specify prerequisites for different phases and kinds of relationships.
In C<RuntimeRequires>, the phase is Runtime and the relationship is Requires.
These are described in more detail in the L<CPAN::Meta
specification|CPAN::Meta::Spec/PREREQUISITES>.

The phases are:

=over 4

=item *

configure

=item *

build

=item *

test

=item *

runtime

=item *

develop

=back

The relationship types are:

=over 4

=item *

requires

=item *

recommends

=item *

suggests

=item *

conflicts

=back

If the phase is omitted, it will default to I<runtime>; thus, specifying
"Prereqs / Recommends" in your dist.ini is equivalent to I<RuntimeRecommends>.

Not all of these phases are useful for all tools, especially tools that only
understand version 1.x CPAN::Meta files.

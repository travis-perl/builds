#pod =head1 SYNOPSIS
#pod
#pod This plugin allows you to explicitly set the encoding on some files in your
#pod distribution. You can either specify the exact set of files (with the
#pod "filenames" parameter) or provide the regular expressions to check (using
#pod "match").
#pod
#pod In your F<dist.ini>:
#pod
#pod   [Encoding]
#pod   encoding = Latin-3
#pod
#pod   filename = t/esperanto.t  ; this file is Esperanto
#pod   match     = ^t/urkish/    ; these are all Turkish

#pod =attr encoding
#pod
#pod This is the encoding to set on the selected files. The special value "bytes"
#pod can be used to indicate raw files that should not be encoded.

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Encoding - set the encoding of arbitrary files

=head1 VERSION

version 6.017

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin allows you to explicitly set the encoding on some files in your
distribution. You can either specify the exact set of files (with the
"filenames" parameter) or provide the regular expressions to check (using
"match").

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [Encoding]
  encoding = Latin-3

  filename = t/esperanto.t  ; this file is Esperanto
  match     = ^t/urkish/    ; these are all Turkish

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 encoding

This is the encoding to set on the selected files. The special value "bytes"
can be used to indicate raw files that should not be encoded.

=head2 filenames

This is an arrayref of filenames to have their encoding set.

=head2 matches

This is an arrayref of regular expressions.  Any file whose name matches one of
these regex will have its encoding set.

=head2 ignore

This is an arrayref of regular expressions.  Any file whose name matches one of
these regex will B<not> have its encoding set. Useful to ignore a few files
that would otherwise be selected by C<matches>.

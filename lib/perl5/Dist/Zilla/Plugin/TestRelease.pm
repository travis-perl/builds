#pod This plugin runs before a release happens.  It will extract the to-be-released
#pod archive into a temporary directory and use the TestRunner plugins to run its
#pod tests.  If the tests fail, the release is aborted and the temporary directory
#pod is left in place.  If the tests pass, the temporary directory is cleaned up and
#pod the release process continues.
#pod
#pod This will set the RELEASE_TESTING and AUTHOR_TESTING env vars while running the

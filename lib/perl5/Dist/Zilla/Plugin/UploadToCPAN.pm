#pod =head1 SYNOPSIS
#pod
#pod If loaded, this plugin will allow the F<release> command to upload to the CPAN.
#pod
#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod This plugin looks for configuration in your C<dist.ini> or (more
#pod likely) C<~/.dzil/config.ini>:
#pod
#pod   [%PAUSE]
#pod   username = YOUR-PAUSE-ID
#pod   password = YOUR-PAUSE-PASSWORD
#pod
#pod If this configuration does not exist, it can read the configuration from
#pod C<~/.pause>, in the same format that L<cpan-upload> requires:
#pod
#pod   user YOUR-PAUSE-ID
#pod   password YOUR-PAUSE-PASSWORD
#pod
#pod If neither configuration exists, it will prompt you to enter your
#pod username and password during the BeforeRelease phase.  Entering a
#pod blank username or password will abort the release.
#pod
#pod You can't put your password in your F<dist.ini>.  C'mon now!

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN - upload the dist to CPAN

=head1 VERSION

version 6.010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

If loaded, this plugin will allow the F<release> command to upload to the CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin looks for configuration in your C<dist.ini> or (more
likely) C<~/.dzil/config.ini>:

  [%PAUSE]
  username = YOUR-PAUSE-ID
  password = YOUR-PAUSE-PASSWORD

If this configuration does not exist, it can read the configuration from
C<~/.pause>, in the same format that L<cpan-upload> requires:

  user YOUR-PAUSE-ID
  password YOUR-PAUSE-PASSWORD

If neither configuration exists, it will prompt you to enter your
username and password during the BeforeRelease phase.  Entering a
blank username or password will abort the release.

You can't put your password in your F<dist.ini>.  C'mon now!

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 credentials_stash

This attribute holds the name of a L<PAUSE stash|Dist::Zilla::Stash::PAUSE>
that will contain the credentials to be used for the upload.  By default,
UploadToCPAN will look for a C<%PAUSE> stash.

=head2 username

This option supplies the user's PAUSE username.
It will be looked for in the user's PAUSE configuration; if not
found, the user will be prompted.

=head2 password

This option supplies the user's PAUSE password.  It cannot be provided via
F<dist.ini>.  It will be looked for in the user's PAUSE configuration; if not
found, the user will be prompted.

=head2 pause_cfg_file

This is the name of the file containing your pause credentials.  It defaults
F<.pause>.  If you give a relative path, it is taken to be relative to
L</pause_cfg_dir>.

=head2 pause_cfg_dir

This is the directory for resolving a relative L</pause_cfg_file>.
It defaults to C<< File::HomeDir->my_home >>.

=head2 pause_cfg

This is a hashref of defaults loaded from F<~/.pause> -- this attribute is
subject to removal in future versions, as the config-loading behavior in
CPAN::Uploader is improved.

=head2 subdir

If given, this specifies a subdirectory under the user's home directory to
which to upload.  Using this option is not recommended.

=head2 upload_uri

If given, this specifies an alternate URI for the PAUSE upload form.  By

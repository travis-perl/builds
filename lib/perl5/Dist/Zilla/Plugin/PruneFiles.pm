#pod =head1 SYNOPSIS
#pod
#pod This plugin allows you to explicitly prune some files from your
#pod distribution. You can either specify the exact set of files (with the
#pod "filenames" parameter) or provide the regular expressions to
#pod check (using "match").
#pod
#pod This is useful if another plugin (maybe a FileGatherer) adds a
#pod bunch of files, and you only want a subset of them.
#pod
#pod In your F<dist.ini>:
#pod
#pod   [PruneFiles]
#pod   filename = xt/release/pod-coverage.t ; pod coverage tests are for jerks
#pod   filename = todo-list.txt             ; keep our secret plans to ourselves
#pod
#pod   match     = ^test_data/
#pod   match     = ^test.cvs$

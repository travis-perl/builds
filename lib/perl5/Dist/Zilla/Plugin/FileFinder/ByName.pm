#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod FileFinder::ByName is a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder> that
#pod selects files by matching the criteria you specify against the pathname.
#pod
#pod There are three types of criteria you can use.  C<dir> limits the
#pod search to a particular directory.  C<match> is a regular expression
#pod that must match the pathname.  C<skip> is a regular expression that
#pod must not match the pathname.
#pod
#pod Each key can be specified multiple times.  Multiple occurrences of the
#pod same key are ORed together.  Different keys are ANDed together.  That
#pod means that to be selected, a file must be located in one of the
#pod C<dir>s, must match one of the C<match> regexs, and must not match any
#pod of the C<skip> regexs.
#pod
#pod Note that C<file> and C<match> are considered to be the I<same> key.
#pod They're just different ways to write a regex that the pathname must match.
#pod
#pod Omitting a particular key means that criterion will not apply to the
#pod search.  Omitting all keys will select every file in your dist.
#pod
#pod Note: If you need to OR different types of criteria, then use more
#pod than one instance of FileFinder::ByName.  A
#pod L<FileFinderUser|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser> should allow you
#pod to specify more than one FileFinder to use.

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FileFinder::ByName - FileFinder matching on pathnames

=head1 VERSION

version 6.010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [FileFinder::ByName / MyFiles]
  dir   = bin     ; look in the bin/ directory
  dir   = lib     ; and the lib/ directory
  file  = *.pl    ; for .pl files
  match = \.pm$   ; and for .pm files
  skip  = ignore  ; that don't have "ignore" in the path

=head1 DESCRIPTION

FileFinder::ByName is a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder> that
selects files by matching the criteria you specify against the pathname.

There are three types of criteria you can use.  C<dir> limits the
search to a particular directory.  C<match> is a regular expression
that must match the pathname.  C<skip> is a regular expression that
must not match the pathname.

Each key can be specified multiple times.  Multiple occurrences of the
same key are ORed together.  Different keys are ANDed together.  That
means that to be selected, a file must be located in one of the
C<dir>s, must match one of the C<match> regexs, and must not match any
of the C<skip> regexs.

Note that C<file> and C<match> are considered to be the I<same> key.
They're just different ways to write a regex that the pathname must match.

Omitting a particular key means that criterion will not apply to the
search.  Omitting all keys will select every file in your dist.

Note: If you need to OR different types of criteria, then use more
than one instance of FileFinder::ByName.  A
L<FileFinderUser|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser> should allow you
to specify more than one FileFinder to use.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 dir

to the root directory of the dist).

=head2 file

converted to regexs using L<Text::Glob> and combined with any C<match>
rules).

=head2 match

The pathname must match one of these regular expressions.

=head2 skip

The pathname must I<not> match any of these regular expressions.

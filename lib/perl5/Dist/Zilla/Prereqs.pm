=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Prereqs - the prerequisites of a Dist::Zilla distribution

=head1 VERSION

version 6.010

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dist::Zilla::Prereqs is a subcomponent of Dist::Zilla.  The C<prereqs>
attribute on your Dist::Zilla object is a Dist::Zilla::Prereqs object, and is
responsible for keeping track of the distribution's prerequisites.

In fact, a Dist::Zilla::Prereqs object is just a thin layer over a
L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object, stored in the C<cpan_meta_prereqs> attribute.

Almost everything this object does is proxied to the CPAN::Meta::Prereqs
object, so you should really read how I<that> works.

Dist::Zilla::Prereqs proxies the following methods to the CPAN::Meta::Prereqs
object:

=head1 METHODS

=head2 register_prereqs

  $prereqs->register_prereqs(%prereqs);

  $prereqs->register_prereqs(\%arg, %prereqs);

This method adds new minimums to the prereqs object.  If a hashref is the first
arg, it may have entries for C<phase> and C<type> to indicate what kind of
prereqs are being registered.  (For more information on phase and type, see
L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.)  For example, you might say:

  $prereqs->register_prereqs(
    { phase => 'test', type => 'recommends' },
    'Test::Foo' => '1.23',
    'XML::YZZY' => '2.01',
  );

If not given, phase and type default to runtime and requires, respectively.

=head1 NAME

Pod::Weaver::Section::Generic - a generic section, found by lifting sections

=head1 VERSION

version 4.015

=head1 OVERVIEW

This section will find and include a located hunk of Pod.  In general, it will
find a C<=head1> command with a content of the plugin's name.

In other words, if your configuration include:

  [Generic]
  header = OVERVIEW

...then this weaver will look for "=head1 OVERVIEW" and include it at the
appropriate location in your output.

Since you'll probably want to use Generic several times, and that will require
giving each use a unique name, you can omit C<header> if you provide a
plugin name, and it will default to the plugin name.  In other words, the
configuration above could be specified just as:

  [Generic / OVERVIEW]

If the C<required> attribute is given, and true, then an exception will be
raised if this section can't be found.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 required

A boolean value specifying whether this section is required to be present or not. Defaults
to false.

If it's enabled and the section can't be found an exception will be raised.

=head2 header

The name of this section. Defaults to the plugin name.

Pod::Elemental::Element::Pod5::Region - a region of Pod (this role likely to be removed)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.103004

=head1 OVERVIEW

A Pod5::Region element represents a region marked by a C<=for> command or a
pair of C<=begin> and C<=end> commands.  It may have content of its own as well
as child paragraphs.

Its C<as_pod_string> method will emit either a C<=begin/=end>-enclosed string
or a C<=for> command, based on whichever is permissible.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 format_name

This is the format to which the region was targeted.  

B<Note!>  The format name should I<not> include the leading colon to indicate a
pod paragraph.  For that, see C<L</is_pod>>.

=head2 is_pod

If true, this region contains pod (ordinary or verbatim) paragraphs, as opposed
to data paragraphs.  This will generally result from the document originating
in a C<=begin> block with a colon-prefixed target identifier:

  =begin :html

    This is still a verbatim paragraph.

  =end :html

=head1 WARNING

This class is somewhat sketchy and may be refactored somewhat in the future,
specifically to refactor its similarities to

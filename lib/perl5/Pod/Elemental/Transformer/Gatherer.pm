#pod
#pod It looks for all elements matching the C<gather_selector>.  They are removed

#pod is placed into the transformed node, and all the gathered elements are made

=head1 NAME

Pod::Elemental::Transformer::Gatherer - gather related paragraphs under a shared header

=head1 VERSION

version 0.103005

=head1 OVERVIEW

Like the Nester transformer, this Gatherer produces structure and containment
in a Pod document.  Unlike that Nester, it does not find top-level elements,
but instead produces them.

It looks for all elements matching the C<gather_selector>.  They are removed
from the node.  In the place of the first found element, the C<container> node
is placed into the transformed node, and all the gathered elements are made
children of the container.

So, given this document:

  Document
    =head1 Foo
    =over 4
    =item * xyzzy
    =item * abcdef
    =back
    =head1 Bar
    =over 4
    =item * 1234
    =item * 8765
    =back

...and this nester...

  my $gatherer = Pod::Elemental::Transformer::Gatherer->new({
    gather_selector => s_command( [ qw(over item back) ] ),
    container       => Pod::Elemental::Element::Pod5::Command->new({
      command => 'head1',
      content => "LISTS\n",
    }),
  });

Then this:

  $nester->transform_node($document);

Will result in this document:

  Document
    =head1 Foo
    =head1 LISTS
      =over 4
      =item * xyzzy
      =item * abcdef
      =back
      =over 4
      =item * 1234
      =item * 8765
      =back
    =head1 Bar

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 gather_selector

This is a coderef (a predicate) used to find the paragraphs to gather up.

=head2 container

This is a Pod::Elemental::Node that will be inserted into the node, containing
all gathered elements.

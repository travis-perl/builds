=item B<clear_pid>

This will clear the value of the I<pid> attribute. It is useful for making sure
that the parent process does not have a bad value stored in it.

=item B<has_pid>

This is a predicate method to tell you if your I<pid> attribute has
been initialized yet.

=item B<is_running>

This checks to see if the I<pid> is running.

=item meta()

The C<meta()> method from L<Class::MOP::Class>

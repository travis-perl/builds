=head1 NAME

perl5295delta - what is new for perl v5.29.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.29.4 release and the 5.29.5
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.29.3, first read
L<perl5294delta>, which describes differences between 5.29.3 and 5.29.4.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 C<-Drv> now means something on C<-DDEBUGGING> builds

Now, adding the verbose flag (C<-Dv>) to the C<-Dr> flag turns on all
possible regular expression debugging.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Regular expression pattern matching of things like C<qr/[^I<a>]/> is
significantly sped up, where I<a> is any ASCII character.  Which classes
will get this speed up is complicated and depends on the underlying bit
patterns of those characters, so differs between ASCII and EBCDIC
platforms, but all case pairs, like C<qr/[Gg]/> are included, as is
C<[^01]>.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email
to L<perlbug@perl.org|mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlfunc>

=item *

The entry for L<perlfunc/-X> has been clarified to indicate that symbolic
links are followed for most tests.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

Normally the thread-safe functions are used only on threaded builds.
It is now possible to force their use on unthreaded builds on systems
that have them available, by including the
C<-Accflags='-DUSE_THREAD_SAFE_LOCALE'> option to F<Configure>.

=back

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item Mac OS X

Perl's build and testing process on Mac OS X for C<-Duseshrplib>
builds is now compatible with Mac OS X System Integrity Protection
(SIP).

SIP prevents binaries in F</bin> (and a few other places) being passed
the C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> environment variable.  For our purposes this
prevents C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> from being passed to the shell, which
prevents that variable being passed to the testing or build process,
so running C<perl> couldn't find F<libperl.dylib>.

To workaround that, the initial build of the F<perl> executable
expects to find F<libperl.dylib> in the build directory, and the
library path is then adjusted during installation to point to the
installed library.

[perl #126706]

=item Minix3

Some support for Minix3 has been re-added.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

L<SDBM_File> is now more robust with corrupt database files.  The
improvements do not make SDBM files suitable as an interchange format.
[perl #132147]

=item *

C<binmode($fh);> or C<binmode($fh, ':raw');> now properly removes the
C<:utf8> flag from the default C<:crlf> I/O layer on Win32.  [perl
#133604]

=item *

The experimental reference aliasing feature was misinterpreting array and
hash slice assignment as being localised, e.g.

    \(@a[3,5,7]) = \(....);

was being interpreted as:

    local \(@a[3,5,7]) = \(....);

[perl #133538]

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.29.5 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.29.4 and contains approximately 4,000 lines of changes across 110 files
from 18 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 2,600 lines of changes to 51 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.5:

Aaron Crane, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari Manns√•ker, Dan
Dedrick, David Cantrell, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, H.Merijn Brand,
James Clarke, James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Niko Tyni,
Pali, Phil Pearl (Lobbes), Sawyer X, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.

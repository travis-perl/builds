=head1 NAME

perl5291delta - what is new for perl v5.29.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.29.0 release and the 5.29.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read
L<perl5290delta>, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.29.0.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Delimiters must now be graphemes

See L<perldeprecation/Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme
for a delimiter.>

=head2 Some formerly deprecated uses of an unescaped left brace C<"{"> in
regular expression patterns are now illegal

But to avoid breaking code unnecessarily, most instances that issued a
deprecation warning, remain legal and now have a non-deprecation warning
raised.  See L<perldeprecation/Unescaped left braces in regular expressions>.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Translating from UTF-8 into the code point it represents now is done via a
deterministic finite automaton, speeding it up.  As a typical example,
C<ord("\x7fff")> now requires 12% fewer instructions than before.  The
performance of checking that a sequence of bytes is valid UTF-8 is similarly
improved, again by using a dfa.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in
this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email to
L<perlbug@perl.org|mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlapi>

=over 4

=item *

C<AvFILL()> was wrongly listed as deprecated.  This has been corrected.
L<[perl #133278]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133278>

=back

=head3 L<perlop>

=over 4

=item *

The behaviour of C<tr> when the delimiter is an apostrophe has been clarified.
In particular, hyphens aren't special, and C<\x{}> isn't interpolated.
L<[perl #130679]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130679>

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 Changes to Existing Diagnostics

=over 4

=item *

As noted under L<Incompatible Changes> above, the deprecation warning
"Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in Perl
5.30), passed through in regex; marked by S<<-- HERE> in m/%s/" has been
changed to the non-deprecation warning "Unescaped left brace in regex is passed
through in regex; marked by S<<-- HERE> in m/%s/".

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this
release.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item HP-UX 11.11

An obscure problem in C<pack()> when compiling with HP C-ANSI-C has been fixed
by disabling optimizations in F<pp_pack.c>.

=item Windows

=over 4

=item *

The C<USE_CPLUSPLUS> build option which has long been available in
F<win32/Makefile> (for B<nmake>) and F<win32/makefile.mk> (for B<dmake>) is now
also available in F<win32/GNUmakefile> (for B<gmake>).

=item *

The B<nmake> makefile no longer defaults to Visual C++ 6.0 (a very old version
which is unlikely to be widely used today).  As a result, it is now a
requirement to specify the C<CCTYPE> since there is no obvious choice of which
modern version to default to instead.  Failure to specify C<CCTYPE> will result
in an error being output and the build will stop.

(The B<dmake> and B<gmake> makefiles will automatically detect which compiler
is being used, so do not require C<CCTYPE> to be set.  This feature has not yet
been added to the B<nmake> makefile.)

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Compilation under C<-DPERL_MEM_LOG> and C<-DNO_LOCALE> have been fixed.

=item *

Perl 5.28 introduced an C<index()> optimization when comparing to -1 (or
indirectly, e.g. >= 0).  When this optimization was triggered inside a C<when>
clause it caused a warning ("Argument %s isn't numeric in smart match").  This
has now been fixed.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.29.1 represents approximately 3 weeks of development since Perl 5.29.0
and contains approximately 68,000 lines of changes across 510 files from 18
authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 62,000 lines of changes to 320 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community
of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the
improvements that became Perl 5.29.1:

Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker, Daniel
Dragan, David Mitchell, François Perrad, H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden,
James E Keenan, Jerry D. Hedden, Jim Cromie, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson,
Nicholas Clark, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tina Müller, Yves Orton.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION> for details of how to
report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you
can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
